Intro
=========

This is a "hacked" version of the google [plus flask-app](https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/python)

Why I did this?

  - Google API does only allow you to list your first degree friends
  - Google API doest not allow you to build the social graph
  - Learn something

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
